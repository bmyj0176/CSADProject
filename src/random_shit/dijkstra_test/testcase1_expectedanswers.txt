Expected Answers: 0 4 12 19 21 11 9 8 14 

Explanation:  
The minimum distance from A to B = 4. 
    A -> B
The minimum distance from A to C = 12. 
    A -> B -> C
The minimum distance from A to D = 19. 
    A -> B -> C -> D 
The minimum distance from A to E = 21. 
    A -> H -> G -> F -> E
The minimum distance from A to F = 11. 
    A -> H -> G -> F 
The minimum distance from A to G = 9. 
    A -> H -> G
The minimum distance from A to H = 8. 
    A -> H
The minimum distance from A to I = 14. 
    A -> B -> C -> I
